# download-organizer
A Python script to automatically organize files in your Downloads folder by categorizing them based on their file extensions. This script creates directories for different file types (e.g., images, documents, audio files) and moves the corresponding files into these directories. Files with unknown extensions are moved to an other_files folder.
